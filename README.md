### Introduction

This is an jupyter notebook intended to teach some of the basics
of data analytics and data processing for the problem of predicting
the maximum capacity of a Li-ion battery as a function of its
voltage and current versus time signature for a particular cycle.

We will be using cycling data described in the following publication:
Severson, K.A., Attia, P.M., Jin, N. et al. Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation. Nat Energy 4, 383â€“391 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-019-0356-8
